PORTFOLIO - LEWIS M
Hi, I'm Lewis Miller—a passionate Computer Science student at Southern Virginia University, set to graduate in January 2027. With a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development, I thrive on building innovative solutions that bridge technology and user experience.

My journey in tech includes roles as an IT Technician at Seed To Table, where I honed my problem-solving skills in hardware and software, and as a Full Stack Developer for CTR Trades, where I designed e-commerce platforms, interactive communities, and even a Python-based Discord Bot for trading analytics. As the owner of LEWON Styles, I successfully managed an e-commerce business, handling everything from website development to marketing, achieving over 100 sales.

I love tackling projects that challenge me to grow—whether it’s developing a Trading Journal with real-time BTC API integrations, creating an interactive Family Search RPG game, or hosting databases on AWS and Google Cloud. My goal is to leverage technology to solve real-world problems and empower others through education, like the learning modules I built for crypto beginners.

Beyond tech, I’ve served as a leader in my LDS mission in Brazil, guiding fellow missionaries and fostering community. I’m driven by curiosity, collaboration, and a commitment to excellence in every endeavor.

Let’s connect and explore how we can build something amazing together!

Skills: Full Stack Development, Python, SQL, AWS, Flutter/Dart, E-Commerce, SEO, Project Management
